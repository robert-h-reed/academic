This repository contains materials contributed by academic users of the Databricks free edition.

Each folder listed below contains files targeted towards a specific project or task.

* <h3>loading_data_from_kaggle</h3>Python notebooks for downloading files from a Kaggle dataset to your Databricks catalog and creating tables.  These notebooks were used in an undergraduate information systems class to get students setup with data at the start of the semester based on the Yelp Academic Dataset (made available by Yelp on Kaggle in 2022). The files can be adapted to use other Kaggle datasets.
